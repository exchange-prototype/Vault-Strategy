# Vault-Strategy
This code allows for the systematic backtesting of LP strategies.  For now we only consider Uniswap V3 settings in the Uniswap V2 environment.

## Available Scripts

In the systematic folder you can find UniswapV3, the main backtesting script.

In the data folder you can find scrape.py, a file for getting the necessary backtest data from the ChainVault API.
